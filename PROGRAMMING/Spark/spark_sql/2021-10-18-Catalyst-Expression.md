# Catalyst Expression

> Spark SQL is one of the newest and most technically involved components of Spark. It powers both SQL queries and the new [DataFrame API](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/02/17/introducing-dataframes-in-spark-for-large-scale-data-science.html). At the core of Spark SQL is the [Catalyst optimizer](https://databricks.com/glossary/catalyst-optimizer), which leverages advanced programming language features (e.g. Scala’s [pattern matching](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/pattern-matching.html) and [quasiquotes](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/quasiquotes/intro.html)) in a novel way to build an extensible query optimizer.
