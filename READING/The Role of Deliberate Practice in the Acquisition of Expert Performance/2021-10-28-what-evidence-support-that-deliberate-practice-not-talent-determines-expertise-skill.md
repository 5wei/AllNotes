# 作者提供了什么证据，表明是刻意练习，而不是天赋，决定了一个人能否获得专业技能？

> The relation of IQ to exceptional performance is rather weak in many domains, including music (Shuter-Dyson, 1982) and chess (Doll & Mayr, 1987). For scientists, engineers, and medical doctors that complete the required education and training, the correlations between ability measures and occupational success are only around 0.2, accounting for only 4% of the variance (Baird, 1985).

在很多领域，天赋不能决定一个人能否获得专业技能

> experts are faster and more accurate than less accomplished individuals. However, experts' superior speed in their domain of expertise does not transfer to general tests of speed, such as simple RT, or to general tests of perception (Starkes, 1987; Starkes & Deakin, 1984). ...the memory of experts is no better than that of ordinary individuals.

> The domain-specific nature of experts' superior performance implies that acquired knowledge and skill are important to attainment of expert performance.

专家的速度、准确性以及记忆都仅局限在自己的专业领域上，这说明专家的专家表现不是由天赋决定的。

> In summary, the search for stable heritable characteristics that could predict or at least account for the superior performance of eminent individuals has been surprisingly unsuccessful.

~~由这个 summary 可以看出来，作者的这篇论文主旨在于推翻高尔顿（ Gallon ）的遗传天赋说观点，进步有限，于是被下一代专家研究批评。~~
