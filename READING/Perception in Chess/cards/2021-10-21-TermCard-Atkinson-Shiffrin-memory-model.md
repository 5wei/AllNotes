# 术语卡：Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model

## 定义

> The **Atkinson–Shiffrin model** (also known as the **multi-store model** or **modal model**) is a model of [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory) proposed in 1968 by [Richard Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_C._Atkinson) and [Richard Shiffrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Shiffrin).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson–Shiffrin_memory_model#cite_note-AtkinsonShiffrin1968-1) The model asserts that human memory has three separate components: 
>
> 1. a *[sensory register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson–Shiffrin_memory_model#Sensory_register)*, where sensory information enters memory,
> 2. a *[short-term store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson–Shiffrin_memory_model#Short-term_store)*, also called *working memory* or *short-term memory*, which receives and holds input from both the sensory register and the long-term store, and
> 3. a *[long-term store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson–Shiffrin_memory_model#Long-term_store)*, where information which has been rehearsed (explained below) in the short-term store is held indefinitely.
