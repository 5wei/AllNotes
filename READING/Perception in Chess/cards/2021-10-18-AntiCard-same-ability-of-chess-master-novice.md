# 反常识卡：国际象棋高手很多能力和新手平级

## 常识

象棋高手推理的深度以及对棋局的记忆要比新手要优秀。

## 反常识

> In his search for differences between masters and weaker players, de Groot was unable to find any gross differences in the statistics of their thought processes: the number of moves considered, search heuristics, depth of search, and so on.
>
> Ref. (Precption in Chess (P.55 Preface))

比如：象棋高手推理的深度不比新手多，甚至可能更少；在棋子随机无序摆放时，象棋高手对棋局的记忆不比新手更好。

> Hence, the masters appear to be constrained by the same  severe short-term memory limits as  everyone else ( Miller, 1956), and their superior performance with “meaningful” positions must lie in their ability to  perceive structure in such positions and  encode them in chunks.
>
> Ref. (Precption in Chess (P.56 Preface))

高手比新手强大的地方在于组块能力。

## 例子

> Masters search through about the same number of possibilities as weaker players—perhaps even fewer, almost certainly not more—but they are very good at coming up with the “right” moves for further consideration, whereas weaker players spend considerable time analyzing the consequences of bad moves.
>
> Ref. (Precption in Chess (P.55 Preface))

> This result could not be attributed to the masters’ generally superior memory ability, for when chess positions were constructed by placing the same numbers of pieces randomly on the board, the masters could then do no better in reconstructing them than weaker players.
>
> Ref. (Precption in Chess (P.56 Preface))

## 理解

通过这个例子引出：决定高手和新手能力区别的不是推理的深度或对随机棋局的记忆，而是后续谈到的 perceptual process 和 chunks 。
