> We interpret this hypothesis to mean that M’s superior recall should be associated with larger chunks, but that the  number of  chunks should be  a  small constant within the memory span (7 ± 2) for all subjects.

according hypothesis, master's perception chunk is larger then beginer.

> In summary, the data on chunk size and memory span confirm the hypotheses that chunk size  is  larger for more skilled chess  players, and that the number of chunks is within the memory span. However, the hypothesis that the number of chunks is invariant over different levels of chess  skill is  not supported.

> The data suggest that the superior performance of stronger players (which does  not appear in random positions) derives from the ability of those players to encode the position into larger perceptual chunks, each consisting of a familiar subconfiguration of pieces.

master's perception chunk is larger then beginer.
