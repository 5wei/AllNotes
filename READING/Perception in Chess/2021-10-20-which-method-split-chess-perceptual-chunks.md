# 作者使用了什么方法将棋手对棋盘的知觉分割为一个个组块？这种分割组块的方法有什么依据？

> The successive glances at the position in the perceptual task and long pauses in the memory task were used to segment the structures in the reconstruction protocol.

摘要上就简明的阐述了**方法**。

> There are, however, other techniques, which have been used with verbal materials, that would appear promising for the problem at  hand. Tulving (1962) has  looked at  clusters in  free  recall protocols; and  Bower and Springston (1970) have looked at  the timing relations and pauses in the output. McLean and Gregg (1967) have used pauses to define chunks in rote learning. Ein-Dor (1971) has  studied chunking of visual stimuli in the form of Chinese ideograms, using a  method essentially identical with our perception experiment.

**分割组块依据**：作者的 perception experiment method 是借鉴吸取了他人的经验。

> The time intervals were used to segment the protocols, in order to test the hypothesis that long pauses would correspond to boundaries between successive chunks, while short time intervals between pieces would indicate that the pieces belonged to the same chunk in memory.

分割组块在本实验的意图

> The similarity of the distributions encourages us to consider the following hypothesis about the nature of the perceptual chunks:

> 1. The pieces placed on the board by the subject in the perception task after a single glance correspond to a single chunk. About 2 sec is required to recognize a chunk and store a label for it in short-term memory. Since short-term memory appears to have a relatively fixed capacity, measured in chunks, it is most reasonable to assume that what is held in short-term memory is not the content of the chunks, but an identifier (label) that allows the content, in long-term memory, to be located and assessed. When the label of a chunk is held in short-term memory, successive elements of the chunk can be recovered from long-term memory in some hundreds of milliseconds. 
> 2. A sequence of pieces placed on the board by the subject in the memory task with intervals of less than 2 sec between successive pieces corresponds to a single chunk. The times required for the underlying processes are essentially the same in the memory task as in the perception task.
